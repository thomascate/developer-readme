Thomas Cate, June, 9, 2021

I work in Software with a focus on Systems Operations and big data problems. I've got a wonderful fiance named Quani, and together we have an elderly cat named Mogwai and a tortoise named Manfred. I'm as close to an Austin native as you'll find these days, and I spend my free time either digging in my garden or tinkering with electronics. When I'm not doing that, I keep busy with a huge pile of hobbies including, electronics, gardening, tinkering with my car, video games, and competetive skeeball. 

I was born in Texas and have spent most of my life here, except for a few years as a kid where we bounced around between California, Arizona and Maryland. I moved to the Austin area in the mid 90s, Pflugerville to be specific and at some point decided that was my home. Most of my teenage years were spent wearing black and playing guitar. Once out of High School I went to Austin Community College and focused on music. This was a major I was woefully unprepared for and I ended up working tech jobs to pay the bills and eventually focused entirely on work and dropped out.

Over the last 20 years I've done Computer Repair, Tech Support, Video Game testing, Network Engineering, System Administation and DevOps Customer Success. Somewhere along the line I realized that I enjoyed working on big data problems and started focusing more on tooling around that. Starting with Perl and RRD files, then moving to MySQL and Mongo and eventually digging into Elasticsearch. In the last roughly 6 years have been focusing in more and more on that. 

I plan to marry Quani in mid April 2022 and throw a big party for all of our friends here in Austin. For work I want to keep chewing on interesting data and automation problems.
